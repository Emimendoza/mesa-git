<p>
Mesa is a collection of conformant and non-conformant implementations of the
OpenGL*, OpenGL ES*, Vulkan**, EGL**, and OpenCL*** APIs. Some implementations
designed to utilize hardware produced by registered adopters of a
specification have been tested for conformance to the relevant API
specification according to
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/conformance_procedures.pdf">published procedures</a>.
However, implementations that have not been tested by the Khronos Group,
including all software implementations, are officially non-conformant. To
the extent that such non-conformant implementations utilize the command syntax
or state machines of Khronos APIs, it does so with authorization from
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/">The Khronos Group, Inc</a>. However, the
authors make no claim that Mesa is associated with The Khronos Group
or that any unregistered implementations are in any way compatible replacement
for registered implementations they may resemble. Those who want a licensed
implementation of Khronos API specifications in the case that Mesa does not 
provide one should contact a registered vendor. A list of registered adopters
for each specification can be found
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-companies">here</a>.
