/**
 * \file branch_and_bound.c
 * Implementation of the branch-and-bound algorithm for combinatorial
 * optimization.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound.
 *
 * This implementation deviates from the straght forward implementation
 * slightly.  In the "typical" implementation, the list of nodes is either a
 * priority queue sorted by heuristic or a FIFO queue.  When the FIFO strategy
 * is used, the algorithm behaves as depth-first search.  When the priority
 * queue strategy is used and the heuristic is not very accurate, the
 * algorithm devolves into breadth-first search.
 *
 * Start in FIFO mode until a solution is found, then switch to priority mode.
 * If a "large" number of steps have occured without reaching another
 * solution, assume the search is behaving more like BFS and switch back to
 * FIFO for awhile.
 *
 * Finally, the algorithm will halt and return the best yet known solution
 * after a fixed number of iterations.
 *
 * There may be better solutions to this problem, and there are some papers on
 * this topic.  For a survey of related work, see
 * https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572528616000062.
