    softpipe/aniso: move DDQ calculation to after scaling.
    
    I've read the papers on EWA filters and it seems like the calculate
    DDQ = 2 * A after the scaling of A happens. This seems to make
    things less blurry and more like real aniso.

    pan/bi: Shrink live array to 8-bits
    
    We only actually use 4-bits, so we could shrink again. But this by
    itself means 1/2 the memory usage for liveness analysis and 1/2 the
    copying/alloc/free.

    pan/bi: Copy block bi_block
    
    Gets rid of the silly inheritance everywhere, which has caused _far_
    more problems in practice than it has fixed. It was an idea I tried
    before the pandemic. It didn't work. I'm finally cleaning it up.

    aco: Fix how p_elect interacts with optimizations.
    
    Since p_elect doesn't have any operands, ACO's value numbering and/or
    the pre-RA optimizer could currently recognize two p_elect instructions
    in two different blocks as the same.
    
    This patch adds exec as an operand to p_elect in order to achieve
    correct behavior.
